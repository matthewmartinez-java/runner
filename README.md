# runner

This was my first ever game created in JavaScript. I decided to created a rendition of the Google Dinosour Game that appears on Google Chrome when you do not have access to the internet. I remember playing this game as a kid and wanted to recreate it but in a funny way. I made the dinosour character a coder and the obstacles it has to evade a semicolon ";". This is an insider joke that programmers avoid using semicolons and spend a lot of timme trying to debug code just to find out a semicolon is missing!
